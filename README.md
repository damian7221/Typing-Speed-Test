## Typing Speed Test

Typing Speed Test is a Java-based window application that allows users to measure their typing speed on the keyboard. The program randomly selects words from a text file containing around 9,000 words and displays them to the user. Upon starting the test, the user has 60 seconds to input as many words as possible. After the time is up, the program provides the result, which is the number of correctly entered words per minute.
